# Project Plan

## Current Status
- ✅ Created feature branch `feature/bypass-login-button`
- ✅ Implemented bypass login functionality across three files:
  - AuthContext: Added `bypassLogin` method
  - API route: Added bypass handling in POST endpoint
  - PasswordGate: Added prominent bypass button UI
- ✅ Dependencies installed for local testing
- ✅ Successfully tested bypass functionality locally
- ✅ Merged to main and pushed to remote repository

## Immediate Goals
- ✅ Commit the bypass login feature implementation
- ✅ Test the bypass functionality locally
- ✅ Verify normal login still works correctly
- ✅ Deploy changes to main branch

## Files to Touch & Why
- src/contexts/AuthContext.js: Added bypassLogin method with clear BYPASS_FEATURE comments
- src/app/api/auth/route.js: Added bypass request handling with isolation comments
- src/components/PasswordGate.js: Added prominent "Skip Login – Check Out Portfolio" button
- PLAN.md: Project planning and tracking

## Why This Approach
- All bypass code is clearly marked with BYPASS_FEATURE comments for easy removal
- Bypass logic is isolated and doesn't interfere with normal authentication flow
- UI button is prominent and inviting as requested
- No security vulnerabilities introduced (bypass is explicit, not a backdoor)
- Easy to remove by deleting marked sections

## Next Goals
- ✅ Start local development server for testing
- ✅ Verify bypass button works correctly
- ✅ Test that normal password login still functions
- Document removal process for when bypass is no longer needed

## Deployment Status
- **Feature Branch**: `feature/bypass-login-button` (commit 99bd120)
- **Main Branch**: Successfully merged and pushed to origin/main
- **Live Status**: Bypass login button now available in production
- **Removal**: When ready to remove, delete all code sections marked with `BYPASS_FEATURE` comments
